# Effect of Computer Device on Sensitive Mental Health Survey Questions

*Rebecca Oh*

### Introduction

With the advancement of technology and growing desire for privacy, using personalized devices has been a favorable method of completing surveys compared to other modes of data collection (Gnambs & Kaspar, 2014; Mavletova & Couper, 2013), and it has allowed researchers to obtain a more complete dataset than without these devices (Bowling, 2005). Some research has found little change in data quality from using different devices (Tourangeau et al., 2018). Other research suggests that self-administered modes produce more accurate and less biased results than other modes when survey questions are sensitive and difficult to answer truthfully (Kays, Gathercoal, & Buhrow, 2012; Tourangeau & Yan, 2007). Specifically in regards to mental health questions, researchers have found misreport with this sensitive topic (Kays, Gathercoal, & Buhrow, 2012), which can lead to erroneous treatment due to inaccurate understanding of patients’ mental health condition (Parcesepe & Cabassa, 2012). This is problematic and fosters growing concerns about the patterns of disclosure with socially undesirable behaviors (Tourangeau & Yan, 2007). Thus, continued study focusing on the measurement of sensitive survey items related to mental health in web surveys using three different types of computer devices (smartphone, tablet, PC) can be a crucial step in improving data quality – and in turn – potentially playing a role in providing accurate treatments for mental health patients. 

In particular, the following research questions of interest will be addressed: 
(1) Does the type of computer device cause significant differences in measuring sensitive survey items pertaining to mental health? 
(2) Which computer device will provide the better measurements? 
(3) Is there an interaction between device optimality for sensitive survey items and respondent characteristics?
